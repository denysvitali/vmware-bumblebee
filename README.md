Bash Script to start VMware Workstation under Bumblebee Primus/Optimus hybrid drivers

To new users, especially those coming from other forum posts: Please check the issues tab.  I only have Ubuntu, but other developers have added Fedora, OpenSUSE and Arch support.  I'm using the Issues to track things that aren't working, and as you can see, this is still actively developed, but it needs feedback for that to work.

Thank you in advance!
