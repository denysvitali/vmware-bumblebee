To new users, especially those coming from other forum posts: Please check the issues tab.  I only have Ubuntu, but other developers have added Fedora, OpenSUSE, Arch, and Debian support.  I'm using the Issues to track things that aren't working, and as you can see, this is still actively developed, but it needs feedback for that to work.
